 "text": "Maximizing the impact and efficiency of human capital in organizations is one of the cornerstones of industrial and organizational psychology inquiry. It is commonly believed that such maximization benefits individuals as well as the organizations in which they work. Indeed, research in applied psychology and strategic human resource management clearly indicates that investing in human capital can yield positive individual - as well as organization-level performance outcomes (e.g., Becker & Huselid, 2006; Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Huselid, 1995; Le, Oh, Shaffer, & Schmidt, 2007; Subramony, Krause, Norton, & Burns, 2008). Thus, a key tenet within micro organizational inquiry is that the human capital available to an organization has potentially important performance implications (Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang, & Takeuchi, 2007).",
