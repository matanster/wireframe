     "text":     "Theory at both the micro and macro level predicts that investments in superior human capital generate better firm-level performance. However, human capital takes time and money to develop or acquire, which potentially offsets its positive benefits. Indeed, extant tests appear equivocal regarding its impact."},

     "text":     "To clarify what is known, we meta-analyzed effects drawn from 66 studies of the human capitalâ€“firm performance relationship and investigated 3 moderators suggested by resource-based theory."},

     "text":     "We found that human capital relates strongly to performance, especially when the human capital in question is not readily tradable in labor markets and when researchers use operational performance measures that are not subject to profit appropriation."},
