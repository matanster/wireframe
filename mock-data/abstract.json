 "text": "In recent years, it has become increasingly easier to start certain kinds of businesses (A, B et al.) and a larger number of the workforce is seeking income through entrepreneurship (C, D, E, 2013). In this article we analyze the factors contributing to this phenomena, address how much this is a fad v.s. being an ongoing trend, and forecast the future of this trend. We then discuss social implications such as the impact of education and regulation on the evolution of this trend."
