        "<Maximizing> the <impact> and <efficiency> of human capital in organizations is <one> of the <cornerstones> of industrial and organizational psychology inquiry. It is <commonly> <believed> that such <maximization> <benefits> individuals as well as the organizations in which they work. Indeed, research in applied psychology and <strategic> human <resource> management <clearly> <indicates> that investing in human capital <can> <yield> <positive> individual- as well as organization-level performance <outcomes> (e.g., Becker & Huselid, 2006; Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Huselid, 1995; Le, Oh, Shaffer, & Schmidt, 2007; Subramony, Krause, Norton, & Burns, 2008). <Thus,> a <key> <tenet> within micro organizational inquiry is that the human capital <available> to an organization has <potentially> <important> <performance> <implications> (Takeuchi, Lepak, Wang, & Takeuchi, 2007).",
        "Within macro organizational inquiry, <understanding> the <key> <determinants> of organizational <performance> has long been an <important> <goal> (Rumelt, Schendel, & Teece, 1994; Summer et al., 1990). Over the last 15 years, researchers working to <develop> a resource-based theory (RBT) of <competitive> <advantage> have <highlighted> the <role> of human capital as a <key> <factor> <explaining> <why> some firms <outperform> others (Acedo, Barroso, & Galan, 2006; Barney, 1991; Barney, Wright, & Ketchen, 2001; Coff, 1999). RBT argues that the heterogeneous distribution of <valuable> <resources> among firms—such as human capital— <explains> <performance> <differences.> Firms possessing <valuable> <resources> that others <cannot> easily duplicate or substitute for will <outperform> competitors <lacking> such <resources> (Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993). As efforts have <progressed> to describe the types of <resources> <most> <likely> to shape <competitive> <advantage> and <performance,> researchers quickly converged on knowledge embedded in human capital as perhaps the <most> <universally> <valuable> and imperfectly imitable <resource> (Coff, 1997; Grant, 1991, 1996; Kogut & Zander, 1992).",
        "<In> <short,> there are several <potentially> <important> theoretical <moderators> of the human capital <performance> <relationship.> Given the <prominence> of human capital as a <determinant> of <performance> <differences> within micro and macro inquiry, the <initial> <evidence> <suggesting> that the <empirical> <evidence> is <mixed,> and <theory> <suggesting> that there are <important> <moderators> of the human capital–<performance> <relationship,> a <meta-analysis> designed to <clarify> extant <evidence> seems both timely and <warranted.> <Meta-analysis> quantitatively <aggregates> prior studies’ <empirical> <findings> in order to <detect> whether a <relationship> exists and to <estimate> the <magnitude> of the <effect> by <taking> <into> <account> study artifacts, such as <sampling> and <measurement> <error> (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). <Meta-analysis> also <allows> <investigation> <of> <moderators> that <help> <explain> <why> <results> <vary> <systematically> among studies of the <same> <relationships.>",
        "<Grounding> our study in RBT, <we> <investigate> <three> <potential> <moderators>: (a) path dependence (i.e., cross-sectional <vs.> longitudinal study designs), (b) firm-specific <versus> general human capital, and (c) operational <versus> global firm <performance> <measures.> <Estimating> the <overall> <effect> of human capital offers a <benchmark> for <understanding> the <extent> <to> <which> it <broadly> <impacts> <performance.> <Our> <tests> for moderation <support> RBT, <suggesting> <that> <it> <matters> <where> <human> <capital> <resides> <and> <how> <researchers> <attempt> <to> <capture> <it.>"
